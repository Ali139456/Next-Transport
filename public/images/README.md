# Hero Image Setup

## Adding Your Hero Image

1. Save your car carrier image as `hero-bg.jpg` in this directory (`/public/images/`)

2. Recommended specifications:
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - Dimensions: 1920x1080 or larger (16:9 aspect ratio)
   - File size: Under 500KB for fast loading
   - Content: Car carrier truck on highway (as shown in your reference image)

3. The image will automatically be used in the homepage parallax hero section.

## Current Setup

If no image is found, the hero section will use a beautiful gradient background as a fallback. The gradient matches the brand colors (blue tones) and still looks professional.

## Image Optimization Tips

- Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim to compress the image
- Consider using Next.js Image component for automatic optimization (future enhancement)
- Ensure the image is high quality but optimized for web
